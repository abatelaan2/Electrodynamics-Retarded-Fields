# Electrodynamics Retarded Fields
<p>It takes time for electromagnetic fields to travel from their source.  We can calculate how electromagnetic fields propagate from a current source by using the equations </p>

<p>I solved these equations analytically for a current source which increases linearly with time.  We can see that the electromagnetic waves spread out at the speed of light, the electric field points outwards, and the magnetic field swirls around the current source.</p>
